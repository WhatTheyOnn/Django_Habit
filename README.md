# User Design

**WIREFRAMES**

I used Figma to create a mockup of the websites front page from the perspective of a desktop and mobile. These wireframes are not going to be fully implemented into the websites design although the asthetic will be very simular apart from the colour scheme.

**fonts**

I have chosen the "Russo One" font for my header to make it pop out and very noticable to cause the user to remember the name. While the rest of the projects text will be using the "Faustina" Font.

Header: Russo One
